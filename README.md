# UFO-Sightings

I created a basic HTML web page, and used the UFO sighting dataset to append to a table that adds a new row of data for each sighting. Columns for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment have been added. This table was made searchable by incorporating event listeners and allowing for user filtering.
